      <description>Training in a Polarised Fashion It is important that you enjoy your sport of choice and get whatever you wish to achieve from it—be it fun, fitness, welfare, completing a goal, improved health, or just the social aspect that it provides.

So - why would I do this, and what was the catalyst?</description>
