      <description>Cycling Restart Summary So I decided to get fit again. After not doing any activity at all for quite a while&amp;mdash;and not cycling for approximately 20 years!
I thought I would capture the background and the early part of this journey, before I forget the details, and so I can review the reasons in the future&amp;mdash;when I inevitably fail to remember the point to exercising again.
So - why would I do this, and what was the catalyst?</description>
