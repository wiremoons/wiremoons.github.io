      <description>The Background Go is a great programming language, and three of the features I like the most are:
 its easy cross platform program creation - write a program on a Linux 64bit system—cross compile easily, and deploy the executable straight onto a Windows 32bit computer (if you so desire of course!); its modern awareness of the web - and therefore inclusion of commonly required application functionality built-in to the language libraries; its static compilation - related to the first one, but key in that it is only the executable that needs to be deployed—no library dependency, DLL hell, or installation packaging needed.</description>
