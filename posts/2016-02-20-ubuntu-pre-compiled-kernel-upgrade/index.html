  <span class="post-date">Feb 20, 2016</span>
  <h1 id="ubuntu-pre-compiled-kernel-installation">Ubuntu Pre-Compiled Kernel Installation</h1>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>If you are not familar with Ubuntu - a good overveiw of this execellent free
operating system&rsquo;s features can be found here: <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/features">Ubuntu</a></p>
<p>The instructions below are for obtaining and installing a pre-compiled Ubuntu
kernel, from the <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu.com kernel web site</a>.</p>
<p>The instructions explain how a computer already running the Ubuntu operating
system can use the latest Ubuntu kernel available from the Ubuntu Kernel web
site.</p>
<p>The kernels are provided by the Ubuntu community, and are pre-compiled for you</p>
<ul>
<li>so all you have to do is download and install the one you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach will often let you enjoy the latest Linux kernel features and
obtain any performance improvements included - without having to wait for your
Ubuntu distribution release to be updated first, or go through the compile
process yourself!</p>
<p>These kernels include the Ubuntu specific features and patches, but are built
using the mainstream Linux Kernel source code also - so the best of both
worlds if you are a Ubuntu user.</p>
<p>Obviously bear in mind that these kernels are installed at your own risk - so
if you have doubts about doing this, it is probably best to wait until the
newer kernel is included as part of a software update, or newer Ubuntu
release.</p>
<p>I choose this route as I needed a number of newer kernel fixes to ensure my
Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Type Cover keyboard worked properly, and as a
consequence I also obtained newer kernel features and improvements too! I did
not fancy going through the compile process myself - as it takes a little while
to compile a Linux Kernel on the Surface Pro 3 computer, and this method is
practically instant.</p>
<p>As a sideline - the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/surfacelinux">Reddit Surface
Linix</a> pages are a great source of
support and information for running Linux on this particular hardware.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-ubuntu-kernel">Obtaining the Ubuntu Kernel</h2>
<p>The Ubuntu kernel needs to be downloaded from the Ubuntu web site located
<a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/">here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>» http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
</code></pre>
<p>Scroll down the above web page to locate the kernels available for your
current distribution (ie Ubuntu 15.10 is called &lsquo;Wily&rsquo;), and then select the
highest kernel version you want to use. Note that some of the kernels provided
are &lsquo;release candidates&rsquo; - identified by &lsquo;rc&rsquo; in their names. Choose a non
&lsquo;rc&rsquo; version if you need stability over the very newest features and of course
potential bugs.</p>
<p>For example the latest Wily (Ubuntu 15.10) kernel version 4.4 can be found in
the directory <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4-wily/">here</a> at the time of writing:</p>
<pre><code>» http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4-wily/
</code></pre>
<p>Additional higher versions will be added from time to time, so check for
additional v4.4.x kernel versions as needed.</p>
<p>Once in the correct directory for the kernel version that you have chosen to
use, you will see a selection of files. If you want to know what improvements
and fixes the particular kernel version includes, then look in the file
called: &lsquo;CHANGES&rsquo;. There is also a file called &lsquo;README&rsquo; in each directory too</p>
<ul>
<li>that contains additional helpful information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to proceed with trying this particular kernel on your own
computer, you need to download the following three &lsquo;.deb&rsquo; files for each
kernel installation - assuming you don&rsquo;t need any of the alternative
specialised kernels of course!</p>
<p>The computer used in the example described below is a Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
which is a 64bit computer and is running Ubuntu Wily 15.10 64 bit operating
system. Your own needs may differ - if the generic kernel is unsuitable to your
own use case or computer hardware, then select the corresponding alternative
files to those presented here - the overall process is the same though.</p>
<p>Note that in the file names shown below, the &lsquo;xxxx&rsquo; element is the version
number of the kernel - so it will vary based on your own kernel version number
selection.</p>
<p>The files to download are:</p>
<p>The Linux headers specific to you machine type (ie amd64) and kernel
usage (ie generic) - so file &lsquo;linux-header-xxxx-generic-amd64.deb&rsquo;:</p>
<pre><code>» linux-headers-4.4.0-040400-generic_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_amd64.deb
</code></pre>
<p>The &lsquo;linux-headers-xxxx-all.deb&rsquo; which is generic to any of the other
two files listed here (ie the other headers and image files):</p>
<pre><code>» linux-headers-4.4.0-040400_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_all.deb
</code></pre>
<p>The Linux kernel image file is the third file needed, so to match the above
files already downloaded, obtain &lsquo;linux-image-xxxx-amd64.deb&rsquo; - again specific
to your machine (ie amd64):</p>
<pre><code>» linux-image-4.4.0-040400-generic_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_amd64.deb
</code></pre>
<p>The above three files are needed for each Linux Kernel upgrade on a 64bit
generic computer.</p>
<p>Download them and put them in their own directory on your computer, so they
don&rsquo;t get mixed up with other similar kernel versions and files you may have
already downloaded.</p>
<h2 id="install-the-new-kernel">Install the New Kernel</h2>
<p>Once the three files are obtained, you can install the newly downloaded kernel
<code>.deb</code> files (ie see instructions above). The three files obtained that are
required for each upgrade are:</p>
<pre><code>» linux-headers-4.4.0-040400-generic_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_amd64.deb
» linux-image-4.4.0-040400-generic_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_amd64.deb
» linux-headers-4.4.0-040400_4.4.0-040400.201601101930_all.deb
</code></pre>
<p>These can be installed with the command line below - where the three files are
the only ones on the current directory of course:</p>
<pre><code>» sudo dpkg -i linux-headers* linux-image*
</code></pre>
<p>If after installing the kernel using the above command, there are dependency
issues reported, you can run the following command to try to fix them:</p>
<pre><code>» sudo apt-get -f upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>You will also need to update update Grub to ensure the computer boots
from the the new kernel with the command:</p>
<pre><code>» sudo grub-install
</code></pre>
<p>You should now be able to reboot and test your new kernel installation!</p>
<p>Once you reboot your computer you can check what kernel version it is running
with the command:</p>
<pre><code>» uname -a
</code></pre>
<h2 id="fixing-issues-with-boot-problems">Fixing Issues with Boot Problems</h2>
<p>Hopefully the above process runs well, and your computer runs the newly
installed kernel without issue.</p>
<p>Before you install however, you should really familiarise yourself with howto
fixing Ubuntu boot problems - just in case! This information is worth knowing
anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>The Techradar web site has a good article which maybe of interest <a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/how-to-boot-repair-ubuntu-1315203">Techradar -
How to repair Ubuntu if it won&rsquo;t
boot</a></p>
<p>There are of course plenty of other helpful resources on the internet too
should you run into problems - just search on
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=ubuntu%20boot%20failure">Google</a>
for solutions!</p>
<h2 id="updated-information---wily-kernel-443">Updated Information - Wily Kernel 4.4.3</h2>
<p>On the 25 feb 2016 a new version of the Wily-4.4.x Ubuntu kernel was made
available as
<a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.3-wily/">v4.4.3-wily</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the artcile above (ie to suit a 64bit generic kernel requirement) I downloaded the
following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.3-wily/linux-headers-4.4.3-040403-generic_4.4.3-040403.201602251634_amd64.deb">linux-headers-4.4.3 generic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.3-wily/linux-headers-4.4.3-040403_4.4.3-040403.201602251634_all.deb">linux-headers-4.4.3 all</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.3-wily/linux-image-4.4.3-040403-generic_4.4.3-040403.201602251634_amd64.deb">linux-image-4.4.3 generic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Save the above three files in a directory on there own, and then run the
following command in the Ubuntu Terminal, in that directory:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i linux-headers* linux-image*
</code></pre><p>Once the new Ubuntu Kernel files where installed, I then ran the following two
commands (just as a precation) - but no additional packages were installed on my
particular system - that may vary for yours of course!:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get -f upgrade
sudo grub-install
</code></pre><p>Follow the other steps in the main article above if you need more information.</p>
<p>The are a significant number of patches and files in this v4.4.3 kernel - as
listed in the accompanying
<a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.3-wily/CHANGES">CHANGES</a>
file.</p>
