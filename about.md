# About the wiremoons.com Site

My web site is hosted on GitHub and has a redirect from my main domain name [www.wiremoons.com](https://www.wiremoons.com/). The site content is managed using default [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) provided by GitHub, with version control through [Git](http://git-scm.com/) locally as needed when adding posts.

In case you were wondering - '*wiremoons*' is an anagram for Simon Rowe - which is my name.
